# Tic-Tac-Toe Java Game
*Tic-Tac-Toe project for [Udacity Java Programming Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-basics--ud282 "Learn Java Syntax and Functions").*

In this project, we were required to complete the code for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The source code of the game GUI and computer logic can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud282 "GitHub project code for Udacity Java students"). The code needed to be completed to test for a complete row, column or diagonal and announce the winner.

I also made changes to the design.
