# TicTacToe
Tic-Tac-Toe project for Udacity Java Programming Basics.

In this project, we were required to complete the code for a Tic-Tac-Toe game. The source code of the game GUI and computer logic can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud282 "GitHub project code for Udacity Java students"). The code needed to be completed to test for a complete row, column or diagonal and announce the winner.

I also made changes to the design.
